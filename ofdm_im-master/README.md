# ofdm_im
OFDM with Index Modulation (OFDM-IM) with various detection types (ML, Greedy, LLR) and imperfect CSI channels.

- Performance metrics: SEP/SER symbol error probability/rate [2], BER in [1]
- Matlab version 2015b, also working well on 2019a.
- Note that MCIK-OFDM is another name of OFDM-IM see [1], [2].
- Update theoretical bound for BER of greedy detection (GD) of OFDM-IM derived in [1]
